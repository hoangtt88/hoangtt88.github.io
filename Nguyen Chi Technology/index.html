    <p>
      We cooperate with German EPC Contractor having over 7.5 GW of experience
      in solar energy, to provide turnkey plant with PV solar modules produced
      in Germany, with 26 years of linear guaranty guarantee and 20 years of
      product warranty, and inverter 5 MW produced in Germany with 10 years of
      product warranty. These warranties reduce O&M cost, therefore the project
      will be economic effective.

    <h3>Solar Rooftop Solutions</h3>

    <p>
      Industrial halls and office building are characterized with their
      relatively high roof-to-floor ratio, which facilitates ready deployment of
      renewable energy generation, such as photovoltaic (PV) systems, on the
      rooftop. This particularly the case for industrial halls and office
      buildings, which are usually subject to high energy demand for space
      conditioning in order to remove the excess heat gain due to the many
      power-intensive processes. Otherwise, to promote deployment of renewable
      energy generation, feed-in tariff (FIT) higher than the electricity rate
      is available now in Vietnam to subsidize the capital investment. These
      rooftop solar plants have in most cases capacity of more than 1 MW, are
      installed on existent halls, buildings, require short installation time,
      high installation security. For the above mentioned rooftop PV
      application, we design, develop and outsource a Japanese company to
      produce the prefabricated PV mounting system made of light, non-rust, more
      40 years long life Alloy-Aluminium. This mounting system reduces weight
      load on rooftop, installation-time, -costs, and increases thus
      installation security, high labor conditions.Our rooftop solar plant is
      equipped with the German first class Mono-crystalline Photovoltaic Module
      with 30 years warranty, Solar Inverter with 5 years warranty, and
      PV-Mounting System with 30 years warranty, for industrial application.

    <h3>Wind Energy Solutions</h3>
    <img src="./images/Wind.jpg" width="30%" alt="Solar Farm" />
    <p>
      Our partner of EPC contractor has produced and commissioned more than
      16.400 wind turbines with a total capacity of more 28 GW worldwide.
      Gearless wind turbines of 1.5-3.5 MW, with permanent magnet-excited
      multi-pole generators grid friendly converter, transformer is for light
      winds predominate (3-12 m/s), therefore suitable for Vietnam. EPC
      contractor is able to offer the installation of turnkey wind parks with
      the substation including EVN grid connection, to find the suitable wind
      turbine and to determine its exact wind turbine position within your wind
      park and the required distances from neighbor housing sites and minimum
      distances of the wind turbines from each other. Our customers will be
      supported with forecasts, planning, the licensing procedures and the
      installation of turnkey wind parks.

    <h3>Biomass Solutions</h3>

    <p>
      With new development of steam boiler, steam turbine, investment of biomass
      power plant became lower 1.6 USD fer kW and generating electricity costs
      0.15 USD fer kWh, and annular capacity factor is 85%, this means 7.440
      hour fer year. All factors lead biomass power plant as the most profitable
      renewable energy. Biomass is carbon, sulfur neutral energy; emissions
      controls systems and electrostatic precipitator are used to reduce
      particulate matter and oxides of nitrogen emissions. Furthermore biomass,
      unlike sun and wind, is year round and constantly available as well as
      storage. Biomass briquetting reduces volume by up to 90%, makes easier to
      store, transport handle. Otherwise briquetting increases caloric value,
      density, fixed carbon, and requires smaller volume of burning furnace.
      Uniform physical dimensions & combustion characteristics, results in more
      efficient energy conversion. Briquettes burn smokeless, carbonless in a
      controlled manner, slow and efficiently because of drying, higher bulk
      density, & lower ash content. Briquetting burning furnace is cost
      efficient, environmental. Our partners as general contractors produce,
      plan and build biomass thermal power turnkey plant with state-of- the-art
      firing, customized steam turbine technology, flue gas cleaning systems of
      100% ash recovery. Burning furnace, with turbulent and heated flow of
      combustion air, is designed for high burning temperature and for almost
      full burn of carbon in ash. We can supply combined heat, power biomass
      power, wherby waste heat is recoveried by exchangers for integrated
      processing plants as described below in 5, and D, in order to increase
      economic efficiency of the comnined heat, power plant and to save boilers
      and fuel costs of the processing plants.
